# Roadmap

## MVP 0 - Project Continuity Skeleton

- [x] Validate the initial concept against alternatives.
- [x] Reframe Horus from Telegram-first bot to project-centric continuity/control panel.
- [x] Decide `.horus/` should live inside each repo.
- [x] Choose initial `.horus/` structure: `project.md`, `roadmap.md`, `decisions.md`, `sessions/`.
- [x] Decide sessions should be local/ignored by default.
- [x] Add `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` shared Horus-managed instruction blocks.
- [x] Define `horus init` behavior for creating `.horus/`.
- [x] Define session summary and closure templates.

## MVP 1 - Local Dashboard

- [x] Create Python package skeleton.
- [x] Build project registry that can discover configured projects and `.horus/` files.
- [x] Render a local read-only dashboard listing projects.
- [x] Show project summary, current focus, roadmap, decisions, and recent local sessions.
- [x] Surface latest change, roadmap progress, and a highlighted next step on the dashboard.
- [x] ~~Infer project state deterministically on init~~ — REMOVED 2026-06-25 (brittle parsing: truncated bullets, duplicated existing docs). `init` now scaffolds clean templates + `.horus/README.md`; rich population is the LLM-based `horus infer` under MVP3.
- [x] Add a simple `horus doctor project` check.
- [x] Add a simple `horus doctor instructions` drift check for `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`.
- [x] Add `horus forget` / prune for stale registered projects.
- [x] Add `horus reconcile instructions` deterministic managed-block sync.

## MVP 2 - Session Continuity (file-first)

- [x] Add session summary creation/checking (`horus session new`).
- [x] Add closure verification, no agent spawned (`horus close`).
- [x] Add agent-delegated closure prompt (`horus close` prints the ritual for the in-loop agent).
- [x] Make `horus close` git-aware: work-commits-since-summary + uncommitted-continuity signals, clear verdict.
- [x] Add `horus close --commit [--push]` to stage+commit `.horus/` updates (close the multi-machine sync seam).
- [ ] Surface staleness / context-rollover signals in the dashboard too (currently in `horus close`). No DB.
- [~] SQLite session/event registry + session states (`closing`/`needs_closure`/`closed_stale`) — DEFERRED. Premature at solo scale (file parsing is instant) and presupposes the deferred execution layer. Revisit when scale hurts perf or Horus runs sessions itself.

## MVP 3 - Agent Execution (the core wedge; next major phase)

> DEFERRED until working on a machine with the official CLIs installed + logged in.
> `claude`/`codex` are not present on the current machine, so the subprocess-driving
> layer can't be end-to-end tested here. Approach is locked below so resumption is clean.
>
> Locked decisions (2026-06-25): build order = spawn + registry FIRST, then the live
> oversight app. First real adapter = Claude Code. Thin owned adapter against a shared
> contract; a fake adapter can validate orchestration anywhere. This phase also unlocks
> autonomous closure + agent-assisted infer.

- [ ] Define the adapter contract (`spawn`, `resume`, `parse_event`, `permission_flags`) + a fake adapter for tests.
- [ ] Session/process registry: `(agent, account, project, environment, pid, session_id, status)`; survives restarts.
- [ ] Claude Code adapter: `claude -p --output-format stream-json`, `--resume`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` per account, permission posture.
- [ ] Spawn + resume one headless session in a project under a chosen account; capture output; track state.
- [ ] Multi-account isolation via per-account home dirs (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) + startup identity check.
- [ ] Codex adapter (second) to prove the abstraction.
- [ ] Turn the static dashboard into a live oversight app (process status + controls) on top of the registry.
- [ ] Persist the registry in SQLite (now re-justified: real live processes to track).
- [ ] Restrict autonomous closure edits to `.horus/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- [ ] **LLM-based `horus infer`** (replaces the removed deterministic version): drive the official CLI to distill `.horus/` from the project's canonical docs — follow doc pointers (README → status/roadmap → CLAUDE.md → linked docs like docs/HISTORY.md), produce clean project + roadmap with planned/in-progress/done items, mark superseded source docs as stale, and prompt the user when intent is unclear.

## Later

- [ ] Optional Telegram bridge.
- [ ] Optional Tailscale-exposed dashboard.
- [ ] Optional VM/worker mode.
- [ ] Optional `rulesync` integration.
- [ ] Optional `horus reconcile instructions --ai`.
- [ ] Optional private session sync outside git.
- [ ] Propagate managed-block content updates across repos when Horus's canonical block changes (currently no mechanism; `reconcile` only syncs the two files within one repo).
