# Horus — PRD

The one maintained continuity file. Structure: **PRD.md + sessions/** (prototype,
2026-07-03). The tooling reads this file's frontmatter directly (dashboard NEXT box,
`horus resume`, merge freshness gate — `resolve_focus`, Phase 1 of the v3-tooling
plan); the `project.md`/`roadmap.md` shims are deleted. The retired lanes
(`features.md`, `decisions.md`, `history.md`, `execution.md`) are preserved verbatim
in `archive/` and in git history.

## Vision

Horus is a lightweight, project-centric **continuity layer** for official coding-agent
CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, more later). The durable value is the memory plane, not
orchestration:

- repo-local `.horus/` files that any native agent session can use without Horus running;
- a read-mostly dashboard: projects, current focus, next step, sessions, accounts/usage;
- a closure ritual so work never disappears into a stale conversation;
- visibility into which agent/account/environment touched a project.

Model concretely: `project + agent + account + environment + session` — no abstract
identity profiles. Native-app-first: new capabilities are designed on Claude/Codex's own
surfaces (instructions, skills, hooks) before any Horus-owned session layer. Orchestration
is ceded to execution planes (e.g. Omnigent — see `research/omnigent.md`); Horus stays the
memory plane and interops via `.horus/`.

**Out of scope:** multi-user SaaS, agent marketplace, distributed worker control plane,
identity abstraction, memory beyond repo-local continuity.

**Continuity value finding (2026-07-03):** the proven spine is resume frontmatter +
session notes + fetch-first; the six-lane taxonomy was the overhead — hence this PRD.

## Backlog

Prioritized open work. Features and bugs in one list; jump order is allowed — this list
is a menu, not a contract. Mark bugs **[bug]**, ops chores **[ops]**.

### Now / next candidates

1. **[ops] Orphan reap after failed runs:** dead workers leave children holding
   ports (ghost probe server on 8899 corrupted a supervisor probe, 2026-07-04).
   On a `failed` RESULT — or `horus reap <session-id>` — kill the session's
   remaining process tree (registry has the pid); at minimum surface "pid still
   has children" in `horus tail`/dashboard.
2. **Catalog niceties:** badge private repos in the GitHub catalog; "N ignored" affordance
   on the untracked fold (user misread "only public repos visible" when 3 private repos
   were on the ignore list).
3. **[ops] Windows machine:** `uv tool install --force --python 3.12 horus-harness` +
   `horus upgrade-project --all`; eyeball mascot failure dialog + Skills tab; confirm VS
   Code task keybindings under Flatpak. (2026-07-08: the `horus --version`=0.0.5 shadow
   there was a stale `pip` copy ahead of the uv shim — now caught by the v0.0.28 guard.)
4. **macOS validation pass** (needs real hardware): mascot/Tk, terminal spawning,
   owned-window defaults, hook execution. Install-smoke CI covers install/CLI/`/health`.
5. **horus-hub follow-ups (harness side):** hub work in `rafaelmjf/horus-hub` (its PRD +
   execution.md). Parked: JSONL heartbeat events; `--worktree` auto-cleanup; `--worker`
   inferring agent from `--agent` (usage-error bounce 2026-07-04).

### Open, unscheduled

- **Scheduled / usage-aware autonomous continuation** (proven hand-rolled 2026-07-05:
  systemd timer → `horus run` ran one pinned task, closed cleanly; preflight refused an
  exhausted-window spawn). Make first-class on the survival-kit substrate: `run
  --stop-at-usage <pct>`, `--at <time>` / `--after-usage-reset` (defer via `resets_at`),
  `--resume-plan` (cold session = `horus resume` + pinned-task → hold-merge → close),
  unattended posture, registry/dashboard record of run + PR. Local scheduling required;
  continuity must pin a *specific* task. Full learnings: 2026-07-05 note.
- **Project-declared machine requirements** (`doctor` + `resume` + dashboard): a project
  commits `.horus/requirements.md` (`kind: machine-requirements`, `tools:` name/probe/
  install/needed_for + `configs:`; prose for non-probeable deps). `doctor project` probes →
  warn findings; **`horus resume` prepends "⚠ this machine is missing: …" to the seed
  prompt**; dashboard card gets a readiness badge. First consumer: fabric (needs `fab`/
  `pbir`/PBI skills, declared there 2026-07-07).
- **Execution-workflow tuning:** phase-status vocabulary (planned/delegated/accepted/
  blocked) in skill + template; propagate the **model-tier suggestion** into the
  fresh-project template + execution skill + delegation rubric so the per-step tier
  convention reaches every project — optionally a first-class `model_recommendation`
  frontmatter field via `resolve_focus`/dashboard rather than `execution_recommendation` prose.
- **Skill map follow-ups** (gated on real Skills-tab use): third-party copy with
  provenance/diff/trust; invocation tracking; rulesync only at a 3rd tool.
- **Context-cache visibility:** how cold/expired sessions warn (companion/launch/hook/dashboard).
- **Hook generation stamps:** hook configs are content-compared — version-mark like the
  managed block if payloads change, else an old CLI offers a downgrade "refresh".
- **Git-aware overview (MVP2.5):** "fetch all" (never pull); behind-origin / uncommitted-
  continuity staleness folded into the warning surface.
- **Doctor compat (observe):** per project, report what each agent would load (instructions/
  skills/MCP/hooks). **Workflow-policy:** project the branch→PR→auto-merge default into the
  managed block + per-project `.horus/` override. **CI gate promotion:** continuity check
  advisory → required once proven; decide if `init` installs the merge gate by default.
- **Companion signals:** usage warnings, stale/uncommitted `.horus/`, per-project
  switching, configurable mascot background.

### Deferred (direction noted, not scheduled)

- **MVP3 agent execution:** UI terminate/resume; autonomous closure (`.horus/**` +
  managed blocks only); LLM-rich `infer`; SQLite registry only when scale hurts.
- **MVP5 app cohesion:** one lifecycle (mascot ⇄ dashboard ⇄ server, owned windows,
  single-instance, post-upgrade respawn); native app tier (PySide6/Electron/Tauri —
  pywebview rejected). **Cross-machine app:** machine snapshots (paths, sessions, dirty).
- **`horus mcp` continuity server** (first Omnigent seam, if adopted); **docs website**
  once stable; session-host daemon; remote attach; Telegram bridge; Tailscale dashboard;
  `reconcile --ai`; cross-repo managed-block propagation; VS Code full auto-run.

## Rules (load-bearing)

The invariants that constrain new work. Full rationale: `archive/decisions.md` +
`archive/history.md`.

- **Repo-local `.horus/` is the source of truth** — committed, vendor-neutral, works
  without Horus installed. Horus is a helper, never a required runtime.
- **Closure reaches the remote, fetch-first** — `close --commit --push`; refuse when
  origin has newer continuity. At session start: `git fetch --all --prune` and verify
  against the remote before trusting local refs or continuity prose.
- **Three disciplines, every session:** reproduce the gate via a deterministic signal
  you observe yourself — a *required* CI check green on the exact commit counts for
  the test gate; the *runtime* gate always stays yours (drive the real surface once,
  mocked tests bless nonexistent flags); never accept on a report's claims. Bound work
  to green committed-and-pushed checkpoints; safety in code, not review.
- **Hook guard invariant:** hooks signal via stdout JSON + exit 0; every committed
  command carries a per-OS silence guard (`|| exit 0` POSIX/Git Bash; PS 5.1-safe probe
  for Codex Windows). Never add an exit-code-signaling hook without revisiting this.
  Anything committed to the repo executes on every machine it reaches — strictest
  portability bar; the `horus` console script is the only guaranteed spelling.
- **Hooks advise and ask, never override** — injected context defers to the user's
  command; Stop asks (close now vs push ahead); never strand uncommitted work. Emergency
  state-save keeps this: never denies the tool call; worker tree = full-tree commit to the
  disposable branch (+push, `-u origin` fallback); main checkout = `.horus/**`-only rescue
  ref via a temp `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, never touching the user's index/HEAD/worktree. Hook
  sentinels are machine-global under `/tmp` — probe session ids must be unique across
  supervisor/worker probes.
- **Three OS targets** (Windows/Linux/macOS); projections move together across agent
  surfaces (Claude + Codex), drift user-visible; sync compares each surface to the
  installed CLI, never surfaces to each other.
- **Every release:** cut promptly after meaningful merges; install smoke on all three
  OSes; tests on the `requires-python` floor (uv provisions it — floor tracks uv, not
  distro pythons). The bump is **three files together** — `pyproject.toml` +
  `horus/__init__.py` + `uv.lock` — each missed once (0.0.15, 0.0.19-broken); rerun
  the suite *after* the bump (the stale-build guard test catches a skew).
- **An outdated CLI must never silently regress `.horus/` structure.** Repos stamp
  `horus_min_version` (PRD frontmatter); two guards honor it — the managed-block
  Version-floor preflight (agent checks `horus --version`; the only guard that binds an
  *already-installed* old CLI, so it lives in block text, not code) and
  `_enforce_version_floor` (running CLI < floor ⇒ exit 4 on every mutating command).
  Set the stamp on scaffold, raise-never-lower via `upgrade-project`; bump
  `versioning.MIN_CLI_VERSION` only on a real structure break.
- **Dashboard contract:** read-mostly; every form POST is PRG; heavy/network panels load
  async, never in the page paint; a stale-build server never writes artifacts; empty
  nudge fragments return empty (no false "all clear").
- **Accounts:** login-driven setup into isolated dirs; TOFU identity adoption; the real
  email never lands in a commit; forward-slash every path written to TOML/JSON.
- **Git policy:** branch → PR → auto-merge; this repo's main requires pytest checks
  (admins exempt so continuity pushes land directly; fallback direct merge only on
  repos without required checks); offboard keeps `.horus/` by default; `.vscode/` is
  a user surface (static, secret-free, create-only).
- **Delegation is volume × ambiguity × runtime** — delegate high-volume/low-ambiguity
  with a clear gate, then reproduce the gate; stay inline for exploratory/debugging;
  workflow tests require a real distinct worker. Codex auto-edit workers get a
  read-only `.git` and no socket bind: the supervisor owns commit, push, and every
  runtime gate — write briefs accordingly.
- **Model tier is a delegation dimension — match it to the work, don't default to
  frontier.** Token burn ≈ (tool-call turns) × (resident context), cache reads of which are
  ~80% of cost — keep the *expensive* tier's context small: push tool-heavy exploration/
  verification into subagents/workers returning distilled notes, not file dumps. **Haiku** —
  mechanical verifiable sweeps (never the judgment gate); **Sonnet** — most implementation;
  **Opus** — design, ambiguity, the verify/accept gate. Main-session model can't swap per
  call, so cheaper execution comes only via a worker on the **isolated** account (never the
  ambient one) — cheaper tier × separate account is the double win. Rationale: 2026-07-04 note.
- **Orchestration (proven 2026-07-04, contract in execution skill v8):** parallel features
  run orchestrator > supervisor > worker — worktree per worker; claude workers `full-auto`
  (default posture stalls headless, exits 0 with zero diffs); bounce = resume same session
  with the exact failure; after each merge watch main's push CI before arming the next
  (non-strict checks let two green PRs land a red main). Orchestrator implements nothing,
  alone edits continuity. **Commit continuity before cutting a worktree from HEAD** and
  **name any unreviewed-output branch in the handoff**. Probe briefs never hardcode port
  8765; on a mid-run worker death checkpoint output + reap orphaned port-holders before
  your own probes; pass an explicit subject when squashing a single-commit branch.
- **Platform traps:** `uv tool install horus-harness` without `--python 3.12` silently
  resolves an ancient version when uv's default python is below the floor; after a release
  the app/mascot can still be the old install — compare `horus --version` with `uv run
  horus --version`, `--force --python 3.12` reinstall + restart; a **stale `pip`-installed
  `horus` on PATH shadows the uv shim** (v0.0.28 `doctor machine` flags it); ctypes needs
  argtypes/restype; Windows GUI under `pythonw.exe` + reap the tree; pin CI actions to real
  tags; probe the HTTP server, not the companion.

## Structure contract (prototype)

- **This file** carries vision, backlog, shipped, rules. Keep it under ~250 lines: new
  shipped items are one line; done backlog items are deleted (git remembers); bugs get
  appended to the backlog as found.
- **`sessions/`** unchanged: one note per session (`horus session new`), operational
  facts welcome (gates verified, tokens to rotate, dead ends). Distilled notes →
  `sessions/archive/` (local).
- **Frontmatter:** this file carries `current_focus` / `next_action` / `next_prompt` /
  `execution_recommendation` / `last_updated` — the tooling reads them PRD-first
  (`resolve_focus`), so no shims are needed. **`next_action` / `next_prompt` /
  `execution_recommendation` each name an explicit model tier** for the next step
  (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus per the model-tier rule). If the user proposes starting a session
  on a heavier model than the work needs, pushing back — recommend the lower tier, or a
  delegated worker on the isolated account — is expected, not overstepping.
- **Closure:** update this file's frontmatter + backlog/shipped + session note +
  `close --commit --push`. One `consolidate` pass at most; do not chase warnings.
